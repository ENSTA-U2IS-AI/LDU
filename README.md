# LDU: Latent Discriminant deterministic Uncertainty
Latent Discriminant deterministic Uncertainty (ECCV 2022)   
[Paper]()   
[Supplementary material]()

## Note
We currently only provide the codes for toy example, classification and monocular depth estimation.\
The semantic segmentation part will be released in near future.

## Toy example
We provide a toy example for illustrating the training and inference of LDU on two-moon dataset.

## Monocular depth estimation example
In folder `monocular_depth_estimation/`, we provide the codes and instructions for LDU applying on monocular depth estimation task. The detailed information is shown on `monocular_depth_estimation/README.md`.

## TODO
-   Add toy example
-   Add classification codes
